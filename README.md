# hello-world
New repository for the group project - 'fully-committed'

# Abit about me!

# I am currently a She Codes Plus student and we are coming up to the tail end of our program (sads!). I am attempting to start a new project with my assigned group. We have been given the brief for the project called **Fully Commmitted**. 

> In a very short summary, we are building a tool that handles mentor scheduling.
